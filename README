MG Development

MGDev is maintained by Mercenaries Guild - http://www.mercenariesguild.net
You can find us on IRC at #mercenariesguild on freenode, or contact
mgdev@mercenariesguild.net

Only the changes to src/ are included in the provided patch, the rest should be obtainable solely from the pk3.
You will need to apply the patch with -p1 rather than -p0 as it is not an ordinary svn diff
If the diff isn't working for you, you may also be able to get the source from SVN:
svn co svn://source.mercenariesguild.net/mgdev/ mgdev
You can also see a webview of the repository at:
